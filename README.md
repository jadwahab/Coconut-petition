# Coconut-petition

Forked from [Jędrzej Stuczyński's Multi-Authority-SDC e-cash system](https://github.com/jstuczyn/Multi-Authority-SDC)!

### Running the system:

- Run `npm install` within `/client` directory
- Run `npm install` and `npm run build` within `/servers` directory
- Run the `startservers.sh` script in the root directory (starts appropriate processes in separate `tmux` windows)
