# Coconut-petition

Forked from [Jędrzej Stuczyński's Multi-Authority-SDC e-cash system](https://github.com/jstuczyn/Multi-Authority-SDC)!

### Running the system:

- Run `npm install` and `npm build` within servers directory
- Run `npm install` within client's directory

To run the system locally, run the `startservers.sh` script that starts appropriate services in separate `tmux` windows.
